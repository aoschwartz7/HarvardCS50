# Let the user decide just how tall Mario's pyramids should be by first
# prompting them for a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.

#  $ python mario.py
#  $ Height: 8
#         #  #
#        ##  ##
#       ###  ###
#      ####  ####
#     #####  #####
#    ######  ######
#   #######  #######
#  ########  ########

# Prompt user for height between 1-8 and store that as a variable
